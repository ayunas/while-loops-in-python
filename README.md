# while-loops-in-python
A Jupyter Notebook constructing while loops in python
As a beginner coder, I've selected my language of choice to be Python, primarily because of it's ease of use, the fact that it's a higher level programming language, and the presence of a strong and vibrant community surrounding it.  

An important concept in programming is learning how to construct while loops.  This Jupyter notebook was created with my coding practices in creating while loops in python.  I'm taking the free Foundations in Programming with Python course on Udacity, found here:  https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud036/

Please feel free to pull from my Repository and make any changes to the Jupyter notebook as you see fit.
